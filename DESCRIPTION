Description: Data-adaptive test statistics represent a general methodology for
    performing multiple hypothesis testing on effects sizes while maintaining
    honest statistical inference when operating in high-dimensional settings
    (<doi here>). The utilities provided here extend the use of this general
    methodology to many common data analytic challenges that arise in modern
    computational and genomic biology.
